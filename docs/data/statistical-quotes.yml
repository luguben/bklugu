  categories: ["T-test"]

- title: "There are three major types of t-tests: one-sample, independent samples, and paired samples."
  categories: ["T-test"]

- title: "A one-sample t-test compares a sample mean against a known or hypothesized population mean."
  categories: ["T-test"]

- title: "An independent samples t-test compares the means of two independent groups."
  categories: ["T-test"]

- title: "A paired samples t-test compares the mean difference within the same individuals across two time points or conditions."
  categories: ["T-test"]

- title: "The independence of observations is one of the most critical assumptions of all t-tests."
  categories: ["T-test", "Assumptions"]

- title: "T-tests assume the dependent variable is continuous and approximately normally distributed within each group."
  categories: ["T-test", "Assumptions"]

- title: "The independent t-test assumes equal variances across groups; if violated, use Welch’s t-test."
  categories: ["T-test", "Assumptions"]

- title: "A significant t-test indicates evidence of a mean difference, not the magnitude or importance of that difference."
  categories: ["T-test", "Interpretation"]

- title: "Effect sizes such as Cohen’s d, Hedges’ g, and Glass’s Δ provide insight into the practical importance of a t-test result beyond statistical significance."
  categories: ["T-test", "Effect Size"]
  
- title: "Always report effect size with a t-test; statistical significance alone does not describe the practical impact."
  categories: ["T-test", "Effect Size"]

- title: "In t-test, Cohen’s d measures how large the mean difference is in standardized units."
  categories: ["T-test", "Effect Size"]

- title: "Confidence intervals surrounding the mean difference offer a clearer picture of the precision of your estimate."
  categories: ["T-test", "Confidence Interval"]

- title: "A non-significant t-test does not prove that two groups are the same. It simply shows that the evidence is insufficient."
  categories: ["T-test", "Interpretation"]

- title: "Larger sample sizes make t-tests more sensitive to detecting small but consistent differences."
  categories: ["T-test"]

- title: "Before running a t-test, visualize the data; plots can reveal group differences or assumption violations not visible in the numbers."
  categories: ["T-test", "Data Visualization"]

- title: "Report t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, mean difference, and effect size for transparent communication."
  categories: ["T-test", "Reporting"]

- title: "The robustness of t-tests increases with balanced group sizes and minimal outliers."
  categories: ["T-test"]


- title: "Cohen’s d expresses the mean difference between two groups in standard deviation units, making the effect easy to interpret across studies."
  categories: ["T-test", "Effect Size"]

- title: "Hedges’ g is a small-sample correction of Cohen’s d, providing a more accurate effect size when sample sizes are small or unequal."
  categories: ["T-test", "Effect Size"]

- title: "Glass’s Δ uses only the standard deviation of the control group, making it useful when the two groups have very different variances."
  categories: ["T-test", "Effect Size"]
