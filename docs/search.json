    "section": "",
    "text": "Careless responding, where participants do not fully engage with item content, is pervasive in survey research. Left undetected, carelessness can compromise the interpretation and use of survey results, including information about participant locations on the construct, item difficulty, and the psychometric quality of the instrument. We present and illustrate a sequential procedure for evaluating response quality in survey research using indicators from Mokken scale analysis (MSA). We use a real data illustration and a simulation study to compare a sequential procedure to a standalone procedure. We also consider how identifying and removing responses with evidence of poor measurement properties affects item quality indicators. Results suggest that the sequential procedure was effective in identifying potentially problematic response patterns that may not always be captured by traditional methods for identifying careless responders but was not always sensitive to specific carelessness patterns. We discuss implications for research and practice.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{a._wind2023,\n  author = {A.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cognitive diagnosis assessments are frequently used for formative purposes. Due to the low-stakes nature of these assessments, students may exhibit disengaged behaviors, such as rapid guessing and item omissions. Most existing studies in cognitive diagnosis models assume that item responses are reflections of students’ proficiency without considering their engagement levels. This study proposes a disengaged behavior cognitive diagnosis model (DB-CDM) that accounts for both disengaged and engaged behaviors simultaneously. We examined the performance of the DB-CDM through simulation and empirical studies. The simulation showed that the item parameters of the DB-CDM were recovered well, especially when the sample size was large and the proportion of disengaged students was small. The DB-CDM can also accurately identify disengaged students, even under some unfavorable conditions involving a large number of disengaged students. By comparing DB-CDM with the compensatory reparameterized unified model in terms of attribute classifications, we observed that the DB-CDM yielded similar if not higher attribute classifications. In the real data analysis, we found that engaged students had a lower probability of omission and guessing and a higher probability of exhibiting solution behavior compared to disengaged students. This paper provides some initial evidence to support the use of DB-CDM when disengaged behaviors occur.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{lugu2025,\n  author = {Lugu, Benjamin and Guo, Wenjing and Ma, Wenchao},\n  title = {A Cognitive Diagnosis Model for Disengaged Behaviors},\n  journal = {Behavior Research Methods},\n  date = {2025-07-01},\n  url = {https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-025-02734-y},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-025-02734-y},\n  langid = {en}\n}"

    "title": "The Sensitivity of Bayesian Fit Indices to Structural Misspecification in Structural Equation Modeling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This study examined the false positive (FP) rates and sensitivity of Bayesian fit indices to structural misspecification in Bayesian structural equation modeling. The impact of measurement quality, sample size, model size, the magnitude of misspecified path effect, and the choice or prior on the performance of the fit indices was also investigated. The Bayesian fit indices examined in this study included PPP, DIC, BRMSEA, BCFI, BTLI. The results from the simulation study showed that BRMSEA, BCFI, and BTLI failed to detect structural misspecification. The performance of DIC depended majorly on measurement quality, and the sensitivity of PPP depended on sample size, measurement quality, the magnitude of the omitted path effect, and the choice of prior. Informative prior with too narrow precisions resulted in higher FP rates. Empirical implications for applied researchers and future research directions were discussed.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{cao2023,\n  author = {Cao, Chunhua and Lugu, Benjamin and Li, Jujia},\n  title = {The {Sensitivity} of {Bayesian} {Fit} {Indices} to\n    {Structural} {Misspecification} in {Structural} {Equation}\n    {Modeling}},\n  journal = {Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal},\n  volume = {31},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {477-493},\n  date = {2023-10-12},\n  url = {https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10705511.2023.2253497},\n  doi = {10.1080/10705511.2023.2253497},\n  langid = {en}\n}"

    "text": "Mokken Scale Analysis (MSA) is a nonparametric approach that offers exploratory tools for understanding the nature of item responses while emphasizing invariance requirements. MSA is often discussed as it relates to Rasch measurement theory, which also emphasizes invariance, but uses parametric models. Researchers who have compared and combined MSA and Rasch approaches have generally concluded that these approaches offer complementary perspectives. However, researchers have not considered how the two approaches may provide insight related to examinee subgroups. Using a simulation and illustrative real data analysis, we propose an exploratory approach to integrating MSA and Rasch techniques to understand item fit as it relates to differences in item characteristics between examinee subgroups. Our results suggest that integrating complete-sample and subgroup-level MSA and Rasch model item fit analyses can provide insight into differences in item quality between subgroups. In some cases, misfit at the complete sample level corresponds to subgroup-related differences. On the other hand, fit at the complete sample level does not guarantee consistent measurement properties within subgroups. When subgroups are important for scale interpretation and use, our results suggest that conducting separate analyses within groups and considering their results with respect to those from the full sample may lend useful insight.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{a._wind2024,\n  author = {A.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Researchers who use measurement models for evaluation purposes often select models with stringent requirements, such as Rasch models, which are parametric. Mokken Scale Analysis (MSA) offers a theory-driven nonparametric modeling approach that may be more appropriate for some measurement applications. Researchers have discussed using MSA as a preliminary procedure with which to evaluate data quality before applying a parametric model. However, the literature includes only a few examples in which researchers have integrated MSA techniques with parametric models throughout the analytic procedure. We consider a systematic approach for integrating results from nonparametric MSA techniques with parametric measurement models to evaluate measurement quality and construct scales with useful measurement properties. We use real-data illustrations and a simulation study to demonstrate and systematically explore our approach. We discuss implications for research and practice.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{a._wind2024,\n  author = {A.
